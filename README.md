# Server-Gitignore
Some .gitignore templates for OS X Server

I recently had to install OS X Server and migrate over a bunch of different services. I thought it would be a good idea to use Git so that I could roll back as need be. I immediately noticed the benefit, and started using it with all instalations and deployments. It was also extremely useful for seeing how changes in the GUI Server.app are manifested in the configuration files.
